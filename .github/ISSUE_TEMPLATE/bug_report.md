**BEFORE POSTING A BUG REPORT:**
1. Make certain you are running the most recent version of Oceanic Expanse, and all dependencies.
2. Disable ANY other mods, unless the issue is specific to a mod interaction.
3. If the bug is related to a crash, a Crashlog is required and must be provided.
4. If this is a suggestion, it is recommended to instead place it in the Discussions Tab to stay organized.

Issues which do not follow these rules may be closed quickly, and/or not receive any support.

Otherwise, here is what to include:

**Description**
Please describe the issue, in as much detail as possible. This may include steps to reproduce, expected vs observed results, or anything done by the player. Any and all detail helps greatly!

**Additional Files**
Always include relevant Logs! This can include normal or Crashlogs, found in their respective folders. If the issue relates to visuals in anyway, Screenshots will be very helpful and appreciated.
